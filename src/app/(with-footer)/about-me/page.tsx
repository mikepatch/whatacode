					</header>
					<p>
						I&#39;m a detail-oriented web developer with a passion for Tech & AI. I specialize in
						TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and love working with frameworks/libraries like Next.js and
						React. Solving puzzles and diving into analytical challenges is what drives me, always
						pushing me to grow and innovate in every project I tackle.
					</p>
					<p>
						My journey in web development is driven by a passion for creating user-friendly
						interfaces and solving complex problems.
					</p>
					<p>
						I actively participate in local meetups and events, such as WarsawJS, AI_devs, to stay
						connected with the community and stay updated with the latest trends and technologies.
						This year, I had the opportunity to attend the Kongres Next.js and ConfrontJS events,
						which further enriched my understanding and skills.
